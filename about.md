Welcome! I'm Lucas Bleme, a software engineer and MSc student. Here I share my thoughts about computer science and software engineering.

I'm currently doing research on fast packet-processing technologies: eBPF, XDP, DPDK, software-defined networks, and datacenter workloads. My areas of interest are Networks, Operating Systems and Distributed Systems.
