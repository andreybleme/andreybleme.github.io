Welcome! I'm Lucas Bleme, a software engineer and MSc student. Here I share my thoughts about computer science and software engineering. My areas of interest are Networks, Distributed Systems, and Operating Systems. I'm currently doing research on fast packet-processing technologies: eBPF, XDP, DPDK, and software-defined networks, researching systems handling datacenter workloads. 

I am also building [Researchscale](https://researchscale.io), a toolbox for managing everything in a research project.
