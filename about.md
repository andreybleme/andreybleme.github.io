Hello. I'm [Lucas Bleme](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreybleme/), a software engineer and MSc student.

Welcome to my blog. Here I share my thoughts about software engineering, computer science, and internet stuff. Most of the posts are notes for the future me, but I hope some of them are useful for others too.

I have been designing and building software since 2014. In the past years I have worked on many different companies' projects, and at my own startup for a year, building a [job search web platform](https://www.instagram.com/govulpi/). 

I'm currently doing research on fast packet-processing technologies such as eBPF, XDP and DPDK, and also software-defined networks (Open-Flow) for data center environments.

I'm mostly interested in Distributed Systems, Networks, and Operating Systems. You can find my published research papers on these topics on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yt9LrFoAAAAJ), and view my presentations on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/andreybleme).
