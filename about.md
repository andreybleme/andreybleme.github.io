Hi. I'm [Lucas Bleme](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreybleme/), a brazilian software engineer.

I have been designing and building software since 2014. In the past years I have worked at some fotune 500 companies' projects, and at my own startup during one year, building a [job search web platform](https://vulpi.com.br/).

My areas of interest are Distributed Systems and Security. I'm also enthusiastic about History and Socioeconomics stuff, so I'm always curious about how technology relates to it all.

Here I share my thoughts about internet, software engineering and new technologies. Feel free to get in touch by sending an email or tweeting [@andreybleme](https://twitter.com/andreybleme).
