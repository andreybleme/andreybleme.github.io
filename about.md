Hello. I'm [Lucas Bleme](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreybleme/), a Brazilian software engineer.

Welcome to my blog. Here I share my thoughts about internet, software engineering, and new technologies. Most of the posts here are notes for the future me, but I hope some of these are useful for others too.

I have been designing and building software since 2014. In the past years I have worked at some fortune 500 companies' projects, and at my own startup for one year, building a [job search web platform](https://vulpi.com.br/). My areas of interest are Distributed Systems, Security, Cloud Computing and Operating Systems.

Feel free to get in touch by sending an email or tweeting [@andreybleme](https://twitter.com/andreybleme).
