Welcome! I'm Lucas, a software engineer and MSc student.

Here I share my thoughts about computer science and software engineering.

--- 

I'm currently building [Research Scale](https://researchscale.io), a toolbox for managing everything in a research project.

I'm doing research on fast packet-processing technologies: eBPF, XDP, DPDK, and software-defined networks, using probabilistic data structures to allow network monitoring tasks.

I'm mostly interested in Distributed Systems, Networks, and Operating Systems.
