Hello. I'm [Lucas Bleme](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreybleme/), a Brazilian software engineer.

Welcome to my blog. Here I share my thoughts about internet, software engineering, and new technologies.

I have been designing and building software since 2014. In the past years I have worked at some fortune 500 companies' projects, and at my own startup for one year, building a [job search web platform](https://vulpi.com.br/). My areas of interest are Distributed Systems and Security. I'm also enthusiastic about History and Socioeconomics stuff, so I'm always curious about how technology relates to it all.

Feel free to get in touch by sending an email or tweeting [@andreybleme](https://twitter.com/andreybleme).
