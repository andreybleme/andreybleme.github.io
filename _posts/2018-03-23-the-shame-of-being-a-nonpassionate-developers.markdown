A topic that has bothered me a few weeks ago: programmers who only code at work. I was missing an offtopic post, so here we go.

Seems to me that most of people from the "tech crew" has a huge obsession on being passionate about coding. They are always trying to program out of their jobs, running side projects and looking for tech events. Particularlly, I think this is great. Enjoy free time doing stuff you like is good. And if you are really having fun while becoming a better professional: good to you! 

While chatting with some friends and making reflections about this frenetic way of life, I started wondering: is it really bad to be a programmer who only code at work?

Iâ€™ll be straight to the point: I don't think so.

The many faces of a good developer
-------------

During my time as a developer, I have worked with a broad variety of programmers. A significant part of them used their programming skills just for working, they don't care to indulge out of the business hours. Instead of being programming or something related, they use their time to play guitar, run, raise a family, etc. Some of them are tech leads, software archutects, some are juniors. The fact is that some of the best technical minds I have worked with have been perfect at separate their work and their home life.

I'm not trying to stifle anyones passion here. If you love to code, do it at every opportunity you get! My point here is: I don't think you should judge developers skills, growth and development, by looking to their level of passion.

I noticed while dealing with programmers on many different situations that 40 hours a week is enough for a normal developer to improve his  skills and evolve as a professional. Companies should be offering a descent environment for programmers to grow their personal and professional attributes. There's a constant and subtle pressure on developers to be coding, reading, writing and meetup-ing 24/7 in their lifes.

The idea that the only way you can avoid stagnation is to let your work consume your life is perverse. Personal growth matters. This kind of thought often comes from employers who can't (or simply don't want to) give us the minimum required for being professional software developers.

Work with mentally healthy people is much better than deal with sick genius. I know some brilliant guys that makes me feel exhausted when I'm dealing with them an it sucks! I just feel terrible to imagine myself becoming a high skilled developer with no sense of peopleware stuff. It gets even more sad and tragic when these sick people reach management roles and become professionals responsible for hiring (it happens often). That's exactly where this sense of "you need to be passionate" comes from: people without a helthy social life occupying management key positions.

It doesn't need to be binary: you can be passionate about coding and still have a life. The misunderstanding of what well fits to your lifestyle may make you feel amiss (that's a really bad sensation). IMHO there's nothing wrong on thinking "I love to program at work, but I am SO TIRED when I get home that I won't do it here", just find your own way to improve your skills at work and don't get stagnated.

So what's your opinion on programmers who are not passionate about programming, have no side projects and only program at their jobs?
