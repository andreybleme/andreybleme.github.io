Winter break is over. It was great to have time off from university to rest and recover. I have been working on a regular basis at my job though, so it was more like a small-rest and semi-recovering time lol.

Jokes aside, I can’t complain. I spent most days playing Ori, reading good stuff, and being outside with friends and family.

I could finally build the first version of Research Scale.


## What is Research Scale?

[Research Scale](https://researchscale.io/) is an all-in-one tool to get research organized.

I started it because I grew tired of juggling around with my research projects for 1.5 years.

After publishing my first paper at a conference during my Master's Degree, we had the idea to submit a variation of that work to another upcoming conference. I had to run new experiments, use different references, and write the new paper using another template.

I wanted to reuse stuff from my previous work, but where was it? **All over the place**.

Related work references were PDF links bookmarked across folders in my browser. Article versions I had written before were stored on my google drive. Experiment scripts were mostly on github, some in repositories others saved in gists. Image files were found on my laptop and in a shared Dropbox folder.

It took me days to gather everything together. **It was a mess**. 

We should have **one place** to manage everything related to a research project.

You can think of it as a research-focused Basecamp.


## Why now?

It’s been almost 2 years since I first thought there should be a better way to organize research.

I bought the new domain (classic first step) but never felt like I had the time and energy to build a first version on my own. The winter break came, and I said to myself: it’s now or never.

We need to stop doing research like 2010. 

My friend researchers are all struggling with pieces of research work spread all over the place.

Nobody is building a good experience to get research organized. 


## Join me

We are on Beta. It means there are many more things we want to build to make research more enjoyable. 

I have plans to share milestones and details on the journey of building it.
